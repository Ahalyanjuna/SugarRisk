# Diabetes-Prediction
ABSTRACT
This project focuses on predictive modeling for diabetes using health indicators sourced from the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015 survey. Three datasets are analyzed:
1. Diabetes_012_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv: This dataset encompasses 253,680 survey responses and includes three target classes: no diabetes, prediabetes, and diabetes. Addressing class imbalance is a key consideration in this dataset.
   
2.Diabetes_binary_5050split_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv: Comprising 70,692 survey responses, this dataset achieves a balanced 50-50 split between respondents with no diabetes and those with prediabetes or diabetes.

3. Diabetes_binary_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv: Similar to the first dataset, this one also contains 253,680 survey responses but with a binary target variable representing no diabetes versus prediabetes or diabetes. It is imbalanced.

FEATURES
The project employs diverse machine learning techniques:
•	Data Preprocessing: 
Null values are removed to ensure data integrity. The imbalanced datasets are balanced using SMOTE technique.

•	Modeling Approach:
For Data 1: Multinomial Logistic Regression , one-vs-rest logistic regression and decision tree models are used to predict.
For Data 2 and Data 3 : Logistic regression model is used.
•	Visualization: 
Utilizing Streamlit for the frontend, the project offers interactive sliders, select boxes, checkboxes, and visualizations to input health metrics and view predictions and analyses generated by the machine learning models.

•	Insights: 
Correlation analysis, bar charts, pie charts, stacked column charts and box plots offer insights into the distribution of diabetes across various feature variables.

•	Libraries used: 
Pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, and Streamlit for data processing, modeling, and visualization

CONCLUSION
Ultimately, this project aims to predict the probability of diabetes development based on health indicators and provide actionable insights for mitigating the risk through lifestyle adjustments and healthcare interventions.
